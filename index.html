        <h1 class="heading">Who is Lindokuhle?</h1>
        <p class="p1">
          Lindokuhle has always been fascinated by the world of technology which<br/>
          paved her way to the universe of software development, ever since she<br/>
          was introduced to it. she's been coding for 2 full years now and she<br/>
          has accumulated multiple skills and knowledge. This journey has taught<br/>
          her a lot from coding to problem solving.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
          Lindokuhle has always loved art, specialising in Poetry and creating<br/>
          colorful designs.She's never been a firm believer to love at first<br/>
          sight but that's exactly what happened between her and Poetry and <br/>
          she'll forever be greatful to her sister for introducing her to
          poetry.
        </p>

        <p class="p3">
          Although she loves poetry she is more passionate about Software<br/>
          development and everything that Technology has to offer, in 5 years<br/>
          from now she see's herself as a fully qualified Ethical hacker. Dreams
          do come <br/>true you just have to stay focused and lose sight. That's her
          biggest quote in life.

        <h3>markdown Previewer</h3>
        <p>
          Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting
          syntax. It is a simple way to add formatting like headers, bold,
          bulleted lists, and so on to a plain text. Markdown uses a simple
          formatting syntax to accomplish the same thing that HTML does, but it
          is simpler than HTML. I created a Markdown Previewer with Vanilla
          JavaScript.

        <h3>The Big Five</h3>
        <p>
          The term “Big Five” originally referred to the difficulty in hunting
          the lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and African buffalo. These five
          large African mammal species were known to be dangerous and it was
          considered a feat by trophy hunters to bring them home.
        </p>
       <p> Today, however, the expression takes on a gentler form, referring to
        seeing the Big Five—not shooting them—during wildlife safaris on the
        African continent.</p>
