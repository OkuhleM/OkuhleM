        <h1>Who is Lindokuhle?</h1>
        <p>
          Lindokuhle has always been fascinated by the world of technology which
          paved her way to the universe of software development, ever since she
          was introduced to it. she's been coding for 2 full years now and she
          has accumulated multiple skills and knowledge. This journey has taught
          her a lot from coding to problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lindokuhle has always loved art, specialising in Poetry and creating
          colorful designs.She's never been a firm believer to love at first
          sight but that's exactly what happened between her and Poetry ans
          she'll forever be greatful to her sister for introducing her to
          poetry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although she loves poetry she is more passionate about Software
          development and everything that Technology has to offer, in 5 years
          from now she see's herself as a fully qualified Ethical hacker. Dreams
          do come true you just have to stay focused and lose sight. That's her
          biggest quote in life.

        <h3>markdown Previewer</h3>
        <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. 
          It is a simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists, and 
          so on to a plain text. Markdown uses a simple formatting syntax to accomplish 
          the same thing that HTML does, but it is simpler than HTML. I created a Markdown 
          Previewer with Vanilla JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>The Big Five</h3>
        <p>The term “Big Five” originally referred to the difficulty in hunting the lion, leopard, rhino, elephant 
          and African buffalo. These five large African mammal species were known to be dangerous and it was considered 
          a feat by trophy hunters to bring them home.</p>
          Today, however, the expression takes on a gentler form, referring to seeing the Big Five—not shooting them—during wildlife safaris on the African continent.
