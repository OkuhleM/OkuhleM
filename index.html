  <p><strong>Treatments of anxiety</strong><br></p>
  <p> Once you’ve been diagnosed with anxiety, you can to explore treatment
    options with your doctor. For some people, medical
    treatment isn’t necessary. Lifestyle changes may be enough to cope with the symptoms.<br>

    In moderate or severe cases, however, treatment can help you overcome the symptoms and lead a more manageable
    day-to-day
    life.<br>

    Treatment for anxiety falls into two categories: psychotherapy and medication. Meeting with a therapist or
    psychologist
    can help you learn tools to use and strategies to cope with anxiety when it occurs.<br>

    Medications typically used to treat anxiety include antidepressants and sedatives. They work to balance brain
    chemistry,
    prevent episodes of anxiety, and ward off the most severe symptoms of the disorder.<br> </p>
