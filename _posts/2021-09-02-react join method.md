# Introduction

today I did join method.

# Body

The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.

Specifies a string to separate each pair of adjacent elements of the array. The separator is converted to a string if necessary. If omitted, the array elements are separated with a comma (","). If separator is an empty string, all elements are joined without any characters in between them.A string with all array elements joined. If arr.length is 0, the empty string is returned.

join( ) converts each element of an array to a string and then concatenates those strings, inserting the specified separator string between the elements. It returns the resulting string.

# Conclusion

You can perform a conversion in the opposite direction—splitting a string into array elements—with the split( ) method of the String object.
