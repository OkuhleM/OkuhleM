# Introduction

today's day was interesting

# Body

I focused mostly of my time designing the app that I have yet to finish.
later on the day I had a meeting with Tannile and Moral who were giving us feedbacks regarding the 
wire frame assignment.

I watched the videos that explanied more about pseudocode, user stories and wire frame.
the videos helped me to have a more visual understanding regarding the assignment we were given.
The feedback was the best part because it helped me to know where I need to improve and which mistakes I should
avoid next time.

a pseudocode is an informal kind of code that explains what each line of code is supposed to do.
a wire frame is a rough sketch that helps you visualize your App or your website.
a wire frame has two different kind of sketches
* a low fidelity sketch does not allow user interactions as it is often a paper-based.
* a high fidelity sketch allows a realistic user interactions as they're mostly computer-based
normally they use apps like figma and adobe xd.

a user story clearly identifies the users desire and intentions.
user stories clarifies what the user wants or expects to see in your website.

# Conclusion

this was an interesting assignment as it was challenging and gave us time to learn 
the things that we didn't know. we also able to make mistakes and fix them.
Making mistakes is very important because it helps you avoid those mistakes and improves your understanding.
