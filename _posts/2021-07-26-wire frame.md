# Introduction

today I tried fixing the App which is slowly coming together.
so today I did a little bit of freecodecamp.
I will be talking about wire frames.

# Body

Not dissimilar to an architectural blueprint, a wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. 
Wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors. 
As a wireframe usually represents the initial product concept, styling, color, and graphics are kept to a minimum.

Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally, depending on how much detail is required.
Wireframing is a practice most commonly used by UX designers. 
This process allows all stakeholders to agree on where the information will be placed before the developers build the interface out with code.

The wireframing process tends to take place during the exploratory phase of the product life cycle. 
During this phase, the designers are testing the scope of the product, collaborating on ideas, and identifying business requirements. A wireframe is usually the initial iteration of a webpage, used as a jumping-off point for the product’s design.

Armed with the valuable insights gathered from the user feedback, designers can build on the next, more detailed iteration of the product’s design—such as the prototype or mockup.

# Conclusion

Wireframes serve three key purposes: They keep the concept user-focused, they clarify and define website features, and they are quick and cheap to create.
