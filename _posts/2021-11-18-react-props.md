# Introduction

Today I'll be talking about react props.
I chose this topic because I don't really know
how to define or explain what props are but I know how to use them
or when to use them, with that said I don't think I really know what props are.

# Body
## What are props?

* props are objects which store the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to 
the HTML attributes.
* props gives you a way to pass data from one component to other components.
* they work similar to function arguments, they are passed from one component to another
the same way as arguments are passed in a function.
* Props are immutable meaning they can not be changed or modified inside the component.
* they are then added as attributes which will be available in the component as this.props which
 can be used to render dynamic data in our render.
