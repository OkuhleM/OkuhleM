# Introduction
today we were writing a test whereby we had to design a website that plays a sound 
when you hover over the picture it must play the sound of the animal in that picture
and also change pictures when the sound plays.

# Body

The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream 

The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the entire audio file to finish downloading.If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control audio playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.

This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related audio file. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in the <canvas> element without being tainted. The allowed values are:

I wasn't able to add all the necessary attributes and attributes due to not know how to do the task
I spent so much time doing research instead of doing the task.
