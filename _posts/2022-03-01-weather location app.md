# Introduction

Today i will be explaining the app I was tasked to
by Sabelo Msibi.

# Body

today I was busy with the app that Sabelo gave us.
this app requires us to detect the users location and detect their 
current weather condition.
In this app we also have to do testing using the React Testing Litracy.
we also have to use free/public APIs to fetch the geolocation.

# Conclusion
So Far I managed to fetch the location and weather of the user,
I am currently busy with the testing part.
