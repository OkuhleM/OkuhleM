# Introduction

today i was busy with the project that Moral gave us.

# Body

I have managed to add html and css so far.
the project is supposed to be an employee admin tracker app that allows information
to be saved on your local storage.
I'm also supposed to validate my form so that it only submits valid information.
so far my App submits information on another page but it doesn't display the information yet.

# Conclusion 

so far I'm getting an error that I don't understand which is the one blocking my form to display on 
the table, but the table already has a table head only thing missing is the table data.
