# Introduction

today I did freecodecamp and some few katars from code wars.

# Body

I was expected to return a palindrome.
a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards.

A palindrome is used to verify a sequence of numbers, strings, or letters that are read left to right and right to left to match the same characters or return the same sequence of characters. In simple terms, when the numbers, strings, or characters are reversed that return the same result as the original numbers or characters, it is called a Palindrome.

1. Get the strings or numbers from the user.
2. Take a temporary variable that holds the numbers.
3. Reverse the given number.
4. Compare the original number with the reversed number
5. If the temporary and original number are same, it the number or string is a Palindrome.
6. Else the given string or number is not the Palindrome.

# Conclusion

when I first saw the word pilindrome I just thought that the function was too hard and that I couldn't do it but it was easy solving that katar.
