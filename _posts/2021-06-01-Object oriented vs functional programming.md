# Introduction

I'll be talking about how Object oriented differs from object oriented.

# Body

- Functional programming is the programming technique that accentuates the functional factors required for creating and implementing the programs.
-  OOP or the Object-Oriented Programs are the conceptual programming techniques that uses objects as the key. 
- The programming model used in functional programming is a declarative programming model, while object-oriented programming uses the imperative programming model.
- In functional programs, variables and functions are the main elements of the code, while in object-oriented programs, objects and methods are the key elements.

- Functional programming also supports the programming languages like Lisp, Clojure, Wolfram, Erlang, Haskell, F#, R, and other prominent and domain-specific languages. Functional programming is a great fit for data science work, and R is the popular language among data scientists.
* FP languages can be translated well into an interactive environment, which makes the understanding of code easier.
* Functional programming provides advantages like efficiency, lazy evaluation, nested functions, bug-free code, parallel programming. In simple language, functional programming is to write the function having statements to execute a particular task for the application.
* The function can be easily invoked and reused at any point.  It also helps the code to be managed, and the same thing or statements does not need to write again and again.
* Functional Programming based on different concepts is 1. High Order Functions (HOF). 2. Pure functions. 3. Recursion. 4. Strict and Non-strict Evaluation. 5. Type systems. 6. Referential Transparency. In functional programming, functions are referred to as first-class citizens.

* Object-oriented programming based on the main features that are: 1. Abstraction: It helps in letting the useful information or relevant data to a user, increasing the programâ€™s efficiency and making things simple. 2. Inheritance: It helps in inheriting the methods, functions, properties, and fields of a base class in the derived class. 3. Polymorphism: It helps in doing one task in many ways with the help of overloading and overriding, which is also known as compile-time and run-time polymorphism, respectively. 4. Encapsulation: It helps in hiding irrelevant data from a user and prevents the user from unauthorized access.
* Object-oriented programming languages are C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Objective-C, Swift, Dart, Lisp, etc. In an object-oriented application, objects can be easily reused in another application. New objects can be easily created for the same class, and code can be easily maintained and altered.
* It also has the feature of memory management. It provides a great benefit in designing large programs, which can be easily divided into smaller parts and helps in distinguishing the components or phases that need to be executed or planned in a certain way.

Functional programming is used for performing many different operations for which the data is fixed. Object-oriented programming used for performing a few operations which are having common behavior and different variants.
Functional programming has a stateless programming model. Object-oriented programming has a stateful programming model.
1. In functional programming, a state does not exist. In object-oriented programming, the state exists.
2. In functional programming, a function is the primary manipulation unit. In object-oriented, an object is the primary manipulation unit.
3. In functional programming, its functions have no side effects means it does not impact code running on multiple processors. In Object-oriented programming, its methods can have side effects and may put an impact on processors.
4. In functional programming, the main focus of programming is what are we doing. In object-oriented programming, the main focus of programming is how are we doing.
5. Functional programming mainly supports abstraction over data and abstraction over behavior. Object-oriented programming mainly supports abstraction over data only.
6. Functional programming provides high performance in processing large data for applications. Object-oriented programming is not good for big data processing.
7. Functional programming does not support conditional statements. In Object-oriented programming, conditional statements can be used like if-else statements and switch statement.

# Conclusion

Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses different method for storing and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects, and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects. Object-oriented programming is widely used by programmers and successful also.
