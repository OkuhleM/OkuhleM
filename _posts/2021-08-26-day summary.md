# Introduction

today I installed a react textbook to help me with better understanding

# Body

All React components have a render function.
React is a javascript library for building for building user interfaces, It's also a 
Javascript framework.

A Component is a self contained module that renders some output.
components are composable.
A component might include one or more other components in its outputs.
Each component in a react App abides by strict data management principles.

React operates directly on the virtual Dom.
JSX is a react extension that allows us to write javascript that looks like HTML.
Babel is a library for transpiling Es6 to Es5.

You can see a UI broken down into multiple individual pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI. 

# Conclusion
A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier. A Component is one of the core building blocks of React.
