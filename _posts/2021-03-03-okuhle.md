# Introduction.

finishing my website and ES6.

# Body

Today I finally finished the assignment that Moral gave us, which was to create a website.
I also finished the programming language that I was doing which is ES6. Tomorrow I'll be starting a new programming language with Freecodecamp.
My Typing skills are at a constant velocity right now.
I'm hoping to improve them by the end of this work.

# Conclusion

In summary of everytthing that went down today I can say that today's day was productive. I'm satisfied with my website although my styling color isn't enough.
