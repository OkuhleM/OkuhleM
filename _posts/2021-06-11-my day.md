# Introduction

today I did freecodecamp and the project which Moral gave us.

# Body

my project is nearly done but the only problem i encountered is that
all of my buttons are submittingg.

I have 3 buttons whereby the other one has to submit, the other has to edit and the last one has to 
delete but they are all submitting so I was trying to make some changes.
so far I managed to make changes it's not fully working but some buttons are working I can see progress.

# Conclusion

by monday my project will be done
