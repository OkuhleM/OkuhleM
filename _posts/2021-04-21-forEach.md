# Introduction
I had a project or an activity whereby I had to write a function that
returns positive numbers. Since it was my first time I had to research about it.
I used a forEach loop and the push method.

# Body

The forEach method calls a function only once for each element in an array in order.
The function is not executed for array elements without values.

              
            syntax
            array.forEach(function(currentValue,index,arr),thisValue)

- the forEach method passes a callback function for each element of an array together with the 
following parameters.

> currentValue(required) => The value of the current array element.
> Index(optional) => The current element's index number.
> Array(optional) => The array object to which the current belongs.

* to loop through an array by using the forEach, you need a callback function (or anonymous function).
* the function will be executed for every single element of the array.
  - it must take atleast one parameter which represents the elements of an array.

# Conclusion

Alternatively you can use the ES6 arrow function representation for simplifying the code. 
    syntax:
    numbers.forEach(number => console.log(number));
