# Introduction
Today I'll be explaining a little bit of Basic Algorithm Scripting.

# Body
I'm finding this chapter very tricky and hard to understand.
I'm having troubles with understanding it but so far I've
managed to undertstand a little information that I will be
sharing.

## Basic Algorithm Scripting

### What is an algorithm?

 an algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations 
 or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

 ### What's the best way to solve an algorithm challenge?

 you need to understand how to breakdown a problem into steps that are 
 specific and replicable.

 When converting Celsius to Fahrenheit in JavaScript you use the following method:
   temperature in C*9/5+32

   for example you're given a variable "celsius" representing a temperature in C.
   - use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assigned in the Fahrenheit
     temperature equivalent to the given  celcius.
   - problem: function convertToF(celsius) {
     let fahrenheit;
     return fahrenheit;
   } 
   - solution: function convertToF(celsius) {
  let fahrenheit = celsius * (9 / 5) + 32;
  return fahrenheit;
}

convertToF(30)

# Conclusion 

so far this is what I've done as well as understand the other 
examples are still hard to understand so I need to do a thoroughly research on them.
