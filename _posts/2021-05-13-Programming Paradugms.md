# Introduction
In this blogPost I'll be talking about Programming Paradigms and will be going deep in them.

# Body

### What is programming paradigm

Programming paradigm doesn't refer to a specific programming language, therefore it is defined as a method of used to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to a programmer following certain approachs.

- Programming paradigms are essential since they describe and define a programming language and how it works.
- There are two important catergories that a language will fall into :
   1. Declarative programming paradigm.
   2. Imperative programmng paradigm.

let's look at Imperative programming paradigm first.

  > Imperative 

* it is based on Von Nuemann architecture.
* it changes the program state through assignment statements.
* This paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the results is stored.

   Advantages:
  - It's easy to implement.
  - contains loops, varaible and so on.

   Disadvantages:
  - Complex issues can not be solved.
  - Parallel Programming is not supported.

      

> Procedural programming paradigm 

* this programming paradigm allows the program to be organised as a set of functions.
* this programming paradigm is a derivative of Imperative programming paradigm.
* There is no difference in between procedural and imperative approach.

    Advantages:
    - It is able to reuse the code and it was boon at that time when it was in use because of its reusability.
    - they much easier to learn as first programming languages for total beginners.
    
    Disadvantages:
   - it is nearly impossible to represent the real world objects realistically in the procedural programming.
   - it is hard to protect data from inadvertant changes since most data is generally globally leading to the problem of spaghetti code.


> Object oriented programming 

* this programming paradigm relies on classes and objects.
* it organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions and logics.
* it focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. 

   Advantages:
   - Higher Data security
   - Code is able to be  reused.
   - it is Flexible and also cotains abstraction.

  Disadvantages:
   - Larger program size: Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code
     than procedural programs. 
   - The thought process involved in object-oriented programming
     may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it.


> Parallel processing approach 

* In this method two or more processors are ran to handle 2 seperate parts.
* this reduces processing time.

   Advantage:

   - the speed is up
   - the costs are better for every perfomance in the long run.

   Disadvantages
   - Power consumption is high by the multi core architectures.
   - better cooling technologies are required in case of clusters.
 
             

> Declarative programming paradigm:

* it is divided into three parts which is, Logic, Functional and Database.
* it manly considers programs as theories of some logic.
* the programs involved in this programming paridigm usually declares what must be done.
* it can be defined as a style of building programs that express logic of computation without considering its control flow.

  Advantages:
  - the code is short and in order.
  - possible maintenance, independant of application development.

 Disadvantages:
 - external people find it hard to understand.
 - the conceptual model is unfarmiliar for most people.
 
    

> Logic programming paradigms:

* in this method program statements express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic.
* Logic programming can be used to show knowledge in a way that does not depend on the implementation.

        Advantages:
        - programs are more flexible, compressable and easier to understand.
        - It enables knowledge to be separated from use.

       disadvantes:
       - due to insufficient investment in complimentary technologies, users were poorly served.
       - There is no adequate way of representing computational concepts found in built-in mechanisms of state variables .

         


> Functional programming paradigms :

 * Functional langauges emphasizies on expressions and declarations other than execution of statements.
 * It can be defined as a way of thinking about software construction by creating pure functions.

   Advantages: 
   - it gives you possibilities of to avoid confusing and errors in your code.
   - it's easier to test and execute Unit testing and debugg functional programming code.

  Disavantages:
  - Since there's no state and no update of variables allowed loss of performance will take place.

     

> Database/Data driven programming approach :

*  the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken.
* this method is based on data and its movement.

    Advantages:
    - you can hide thne complex data from basic users.
    - several users can access the database concurrently.

   Disadvantages:
   - high-speed processor and a large memory size is required.
   - expensive hardware is needed.



# Conclusion

therefore Paradigms are important because they define a programming language and how it works.
Although these different approaches can be better in some cases, and worse in others.
