# Introduction
 
 today I was converting celcius to fahnreit using javascript.

# Body

Fahrenheit and centigrade are two temperature scales in use today. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit . In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees.
The centigrade scale, which is also called the Celsius scale, was developed by Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius. In the centigrade scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. The centigrade to Fahrenheit conversion formula is:

C = (5/9) * (F - 32)

  Example in Javascript

  function cToF(celsius) 
{
  var cTemp = celsius;
  var cToFahr = cTemp * 9 / 5 + 32;
  var message = cTemp+'\xB0C is ' + cToFahr + ' \xB0F.';
    console.log(message);
}

function fToC(fahrenheit) 
{
  var fTemp = fahrenheit;
  var fToCel = (fTemp - 32) * 5 / 9;
  var message = fTemp+'\xB0F is ' + fToCel + '\xB0C.';
    console.log(message);
} 
cToF(60);
fToC(45);

    Example in ES6

  function cToF(celsius) 
{
  const cTemp = celsius;
  const cToFahr = cTemp * 9 / 5 + 32;
  const message = `${cTemp}\xB0C is ${cToFahr} \xB0F.`;
    console.log(message);
}

function fToC(fahrenheit) 
{
  const fTemp = fahrenheit;
  const fToCel = (fTemp - 32) * 5 / 9;
  const message = `${fTemp}\xB0F is ${fToCel}\xB0C.`;
    console.log(message);
} 
cToF(60);
fToC(45);

# Conclusion

it's much easier when you're using ES6.
