# Introduction

I'm gonna be talking about my day.

# Body

today I did freecodecamp and code wars.
I was doing react and I feel like I need help with it.
At first it was easy and I knew my way around it, but as time went by
and I did the complex part I feel like I'm stuck.

we were asked to create an App, so far my Appis working fine but the only problem
I have is that I don't know how to use the useState, useEffect and the handleClick event.
my biggest goal right now is that I master the react

# Conclusion

React is tricky and gets better the more you learn your way around it.
The moment you learn the words they use in react I believe it will get batter.
