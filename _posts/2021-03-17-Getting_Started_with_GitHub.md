# Introduction

I will share the knowledge I have thus far regarding GitHub pages as well as blogpost.

## What are GitHub pages?

so when I checked the definition of GitHub pages on the internet they 
defined as follows: GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.
I personally would defined it as a site which takes files from a reposistory, processes them and publishes them.
I code using Visual Studio Code which supports a lot of programming language.

## Getting started with Github pages

The first thing I did when I was firstly introduced to GitHub after I had set up my
GitHub account was to create a repository and gave it a name.
Once you name your repository, your files will be located in that repository until
you create another one.

You'll have to choose a theme so that your work looks better and more nicer.
people who have the link to your blogpost will be attracted to your blogpost,
which will make them be eager to read your blogpost.

When choosing your theme you simply go to settings, after clicking on your settings
you scroll down until you see the github pages section near the bottom, from there on
you click on choose a theme button.

when you're directed to the theme chooser you'll choose the one that you like as there
will be several options.
The git client that I'm using is a terminal so I'll be explaining how to I use to add,
commit and push my work on VS code.

The first step is to clone the repository on your terminal using git clone.
the second step is to access the folder where your work is located using cd
and the name of the name of the folder.
The third step is to create a file using touch + the name of the file your
blogpost will have.

From there on you write on that file. you need to add your work to git hub.
you do that by using "git add and the name of the file you need to add"
then you git commit using 'git commit -m "the message you allocate your file"' 
then you push your work.

# Conclusion

you can access your blogpost from github.
you need to go to the settings and scroll down until you find a link.
when you click that link it will direct you to your website so you'll have to add blog.html.
