# Introduction

explaining my website and what've done for the day.

# Body

I Have realised that many people suffer from anxiety. Some people do known that they suffer from anxiety some have no idea.

So my website is supposed to make everyone aware of anxiety and give them chances to go through it without thinking about suicide.

# ES6
today I introduced myself to a little bit of ES6.
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

# Conclusion

so far my website is on the right track and I'm certain that by tomorrow I'll be done with it.
I have over came the problems which i encountered.
