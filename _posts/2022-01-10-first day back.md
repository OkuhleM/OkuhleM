# Introduction

today I'll be talking about my first day back at the coding ground.

# Body

it's good to be back in business after the relaxing holidays that I've had.
Today I manage to start with express and I am glad that I managed to understand it with my first try.
I think what made understand express more is the session we had with Moral today.
That session helped me understand postman more because that's what was my main biggest issue.
on FreecodeCamp I was using relpit when I was using express.

# Conclusion

Tomorrow I'll be explaining more on what express and middleware are and how to use them
or why we usually use them in back end.
