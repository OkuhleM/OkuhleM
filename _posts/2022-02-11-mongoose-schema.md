# Introduction

today I finally managed to connect my freecodecamp challenge to my database.
so today I will be writing about how to create a schema in mongoose.

# Body
First of all we need a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are building block for Models. They can be nested to create complex models, but in this case we'll keep things simple. A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

Replit is a real server, and in real servers the interactions with the database happen in handler functions. These functions are executed when some event happens (e.g. someone hits an endpoint on your API). Weâ€™ll follow the same approach in these exercises. The done() function is a callback that tells us that we can proceed after completing an asynchronous operation such as inserting, searching, updating, or deleting. It's following the Node convention, and should be called as done(null, data) on success, or done(err) on error.

Warning - When interacting with remote services, errors may occur!

# Conclusion
Everything in mongoose starts with a Schema.
