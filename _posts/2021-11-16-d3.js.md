# Introduction
today i started with d3.js

# Body
D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.

D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data. This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS. With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. D3â€™s functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of official and community-developed modules.

Readers familiar with other DOM frameworks such as jQuery should immediately recognize similarities with D3. Yet styles, attributes, and other properties can be specified as functions of data in D3, not just simple constants. Despite their apparent simplicity, these functions can be surprisingly powerful

# Conclusion

Computed properties often refer to bound data. Data is specified as an array of values, and each value is passed as the first argument (d) to selection functions.
