# Introduction

today i did freecodecamp and the app.

# Body

The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax.
With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.
ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.
One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className.
In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick

# Conclusion

I repeated react since I was getting confused along the way.
