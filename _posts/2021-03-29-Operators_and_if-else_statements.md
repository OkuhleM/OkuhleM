# Introduction
I will share the little knowledge I have regarding the operators and the if else statement.

# Body

## What is operator?

An operator is used to perform some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. 

## Types of operators.

- Arithmetic operators
-  Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Conditional Operators

## What is an if else statement?

The if-else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.
 
 # forms of if..else statement supported by JavaScript
- if statement
- if...else statement
- if...else if... statement

The ‘if’ statement is the fundamental control statement that allows JavaScript to
make decisions and execute statements conditionally.

Example: 

The syntax for a basic if statement is as follows:
if (expression){
Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}

If the expression is false, then no statement
would be executed. Most of the times, you will use comparison operators
while making decisions.

The ‘if...else’ statement is the next form of control statement that allows
JavaScript to execute statements in a more controlled way.

Syntax
The syntax of an if-else statement is as follows:
if (expression){
Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}else{
Statement(s) to be executed if expression is false
}
Here JavaScript expression is evaluated. If the resulting value is true, the given
statement(s) in the ‘if’ block, are executed. If the

The ‘if...else if...’ statement is an advanced form of if...else that allows
JavaScript to make a correct decision out of several conditions.

Syntax
The syntax of an if-else-if statement is as follows:
if (expression 1){
Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
}else if (expression 2){
Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
}else if (expression 3){
Statement(s) to be executed if expression 3 is true
}else{
Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true
}
There is nothing special about this code. It is just a series of if statements,
where each if is a part of the else clause of the previous statement.
Statement(s) are executed based on the true condition, if none of the conditions
is true, then the else block is executed.

# Conclusion

I now know when to use the operators and the if else statements and why to use them.
