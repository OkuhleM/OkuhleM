# Introduction

today I dealt with freecodecamp

# Body

Props is a featurein React.
in React you can pass props, or properties to child components.
you can custom HTML attributes created by you and sopported by React to be passed.
To pass an array to a JSX element, it must be treated as JavaScripts and wrapped in curly braces.
array methods such as join() can be used when using the property.

React also has an option to set default Props.
you can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and react assigns thne default 
prop if necessary.

React assigns default props if props are undefined, If you pass null as the value for Prop
it will remain null.
The way to override the default props is to explicitly set the prop values for a component.
The syntax to add a prop to a component looks similar to how add HTML attributes.

React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components recieves props of the correct type.
It's considered a best practise to set propTypes when you know the type of prop ahead of time.
you can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps,

# Conclusion

Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type.
React v15.50 propTypes is imported independly from 
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
