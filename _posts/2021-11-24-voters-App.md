# Introduction
Today I had to build an App that will be used by the voters.
This App Must enable people to vote for their desired or favourite political party.

# Body
Today we were given an assignment, in this assignment we were supposed to create an App that
will enable the voters to enter their details and vote for their favourite political party.
In this assignment we were supposed to strictly use react.

I was able to do the form and make it submit the form.
I found it very challenging to create the delete button, I couldn't target my 
delete button correctly.
At the end of the day my button ended up working correctly and I did everything that was required.

# Conclusion

The most challenge that I had was when I was creating the onSubmit function.
I used the stateless component for the assignment which still gives me issues but I have
been practising more and more that by the end of this month I'll be able to do more with stateless components.
