# Introduction

today I will be talking about the day I had.

# Body

today my day wasn't productive at all my laptop was so slow to the point that everything I did got wiped away.
although my laptop was super slaw I managed to do some code katars.
the code katar that I did required me to change it from a boolean to a String.

The Boolean object overrides the toString method of the Object object; it does not inherit Object.prototype.toString(). For Boolean objects, the toString method returns a string representation of the object.
JavaScript calls the toString() method automatically when a Boolean is to be represented as a text value or when a Boolean is referred to in a string concatenation.

# Conclusion

For Boolean objects and values, the built-in toString() method returns the string "true" or "false" depending on the value of the boolean object.
