# Introduction
today I dealt with more of SVG instead of doing the rectangle today I used the 
scatter plot which is what I'll be talking about.

# Body

Two-dimensional data is commonly visualized using a scatter-plot. Where two dimensions are represented on two different axes, horizontal x and vertical y.
Array of arrays - contain one point for each primary array.
scatter plot is used for graphs.
they are mostly used for defining the correlation.

# Conclusion

- scatter plot uses more attributes and not much theory
