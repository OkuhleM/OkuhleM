# Introduction

today I started with redux all over again, and I was able to understand it more easily.
I was able to solve every problem without getting a hint.

# Body

A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on.
A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it. To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.

### Store Methods#
> getState()
> dispatch(action)
> subscribe(listener)
> replaceReducer(nextReducer)

getState()
Returns the current state tree of your application. It is equal to the last value returned by the store's reducer.

dispatch(action)
Dispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.

The store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.

# Conclusion

takes action as its argument
A plain object describing the change that makes sense for your application. Actions are the only way to get data into the store, so any data, whether from the UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.
