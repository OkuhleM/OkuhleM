# Introduction
I'll be talking about the day that I had today and what I did.

# Body.

Today I carried on with freecodecamp and I also carried on with the SVG.
I did typing more because I haven't done it in a longtime.
I haven't been typing because I was busy with the website which consumed most of my time.
This made my typing speed decrease drastically.

I did code wars and I am more confident with solving code katars now.
My katars score is high and I am proud that I did all of the katars alone with my own understanding
What I am most proud of is that I was able to do the katars with the understanding that I have
for javascript methods.

# Conclusion

I am happy and satisfied with the understanding that I have with code wars and javascript.
One thing I realised is that when you want to solve code katars and master them you must 
understand the methods that are used in javascript
