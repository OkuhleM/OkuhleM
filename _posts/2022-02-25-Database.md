## What is a database4

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored 
electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management 
system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated 
with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and 
columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be 
easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured 
query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

## What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?

SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, 
and to provide access control.
