# Introduction

today I dealt with code wars problems.

# Body

i was summing two strings which were numbers.

- Before we do anything with the numbers in the string, we will first split the string at the commas and convert it into an array.
- We assign that array to a variable and give it a name.
- Next, we will use the reduce() method to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array.
- Since the numbers are initially strings, we need to convert everything into a number using parseFloat().
- Now that we have our sum, we can return it.
