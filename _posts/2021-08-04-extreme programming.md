# Introduction

today i researched about extreme programming.

# Body

Extreme programming is a software development methodology that’s part of what’s collectively known as agile methodologies. XP is built upon values, principles, and practices, and its goal is to allow small to mid-sized teams to produce high-quality software and adapt to evolving and changing requirements.

Extreme programming is precise about how engineers work since following engineering practices allows teams to deliver high-quality code at a sustainable pace.
Extreme programming is, in a nutshell, about good practices taken to an extreme.
Values provide purpose to teams. They act as a “north star” to guide your decisions in a high-level way. However, values are abstract and too fuzzy for specific guidance. 
Practices are, in some ways, the opposite of values. They’re concrete and down to earth, defining the specifics of what to do. Practices help teams hold themselves accountable to the values.

- Communication: Lack of communication prevents knowledge from flowing inside a team. Often, when there’s a problem, someone already knows how to solve it. But lack of communication prevents them from learning about the problem or contributing to its solution. So, the problem ends up being solved twice, generating waste.

- Simplicity: Simplicity says you always strive to do the simplest thing that works. It’s often misunderstood and taken as the simplest thing, period, ignoring the “that works” part.
It’s also crucial to remember that simplicity is highly contextual. What’s simple for one team, is complex for another depending entirely on each team’s skills, experience, and knowledge.

- Feedback: Feedback in more traditional, waterfall-like software development methodologies often is “too little, too late”.

# Conclusion

Principles provide more specific guidance than values. They’re guidelines that illuminate the values and make them more explicit and less ambiguous.
