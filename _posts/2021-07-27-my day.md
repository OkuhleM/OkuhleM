# Introduction

today I'll talk about the problems I'm having with my app.

# Body

so today I carried on with my app but I'm still facing a lot of problems.
my app doesn't submit information to the table, I've been doing exactly what the
turtorial was doing but it still doesn't submit.

the second problem is that my buttons are dead.
the third problem is that it doesn't calculate the annual average yet.
the last problem that I'm having is that my app doesn't validate the Id number.

# Conclusion

My app is not close to being done any ti e soon.
I have more problems more than I have any progress.
I can conclude by saying my app is a work in progress.
