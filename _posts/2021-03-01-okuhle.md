# Introduction

Summarry of today's work.

# Body

Today my day started early. when I first got here in the morning I did Freecodecamp to push some of my daily work.
As the day went by Moral gave us an activity, whereby we have to create a website.
I've been working on the website that I want to create half of today's day. 
My website is only left with a few touch ups.
I finally finished the first part of JavaScript so I will share what I know.

## JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions

# Conclusion

I also did Typing club to try and improve my typing skills and my typing speed.
