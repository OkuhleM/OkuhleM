Summarry of today's work.

# Body

Today my day started early. when I first got here in the morning I did Freecodecamp to push some of my daily work.
As the day went by Moral gave us an activity, whereby we have to create a website.
I've been working on the website that I want to create half of today's day. 
My website is only left with a few touch ups.

I also did Typing club to try and improve my typing skills and my typing speed.
