# Introduction

today I'll be talking about what I did today.

# Body

I spent most of my time doing typing lessons because my typing speed 
is still that of an amatuar.
after doing typing I did code wars and I did this katar that Was a little challenging.

I had to create a function that calculates an average of students and returns 
the ones that were above average.
this katar was supposed to be an object.

# Conclusion

although it took me more than 12 minutes to finally get it right I did.
after being succesfull in accessing the inside of the function.
