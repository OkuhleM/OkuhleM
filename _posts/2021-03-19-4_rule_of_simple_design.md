# Introduction
Today I was introduced to the 4 rules to simple design.

# Body
Kent Beck came up with four rules of Simple Design while he was developing 
ExtremeProgramming in the late 1990s.This rule helps to keep code clean.

These are the 4 simple rules
1. Passes the tests (It Works)
2. Reveals intention
3. No duplication
4. Fewest elements

One of the many things that could make us sure that our app is working fine 
is to have tests for the particular code we wrote. Writing tests actually 
could lead us to better designs.

Too often we get our code working and then move on to the next problem without
giving a second thought to make that code easy to read.  We need to place 
ourselves as other people that will become the next person to read our code.

This rule connected to Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle where we need to make 
sure that one method only has a single responsibility and not repeating. But, this
rule is more about duplication of knowledge, not code duplication. Kent’s form of 
saying it is everything should be said once and only once. Many programmers have
observed that the exercise of eliminating duplication is a powerful way to drive out good designs.

code expressiveness, removing the duplication, sometimes we can take it too far and this rule helps 
us to also check and be aware to maintain our code to have as few elements as possible.
These questions can be asked to yourself when you take some time to have a step back after writing some code
> you need to know if your code is not dead.
> you need to know if you haven't extracted too far.

# Conclusion

These 4 rules are ordered by priority and complementing each other. When you get confused to some extent
because the rules seem like conflicting with each other, going back again to the order of these rules.
so far these rules have helped me a lot with designing todays work, I'm proud of my CSS Grid work.
I would definitely recommend this to rule to other programmers.
