# Introduction

today after the katar that Moral gave us I decided to search for all the methods that can be used on arrays

# Body

the Array.isArray() determines whether the passed value is an array if not it returns false if it is it return true.
         syntax:
         Array.isArray(value)
it takes an argument called value.
value represents the value that has to be checked.

When checking for Array instance, Array.isArray is preferred over instanceof because it works through iframes.
The problem is it doesn't work with multiple context (e.g. frames or windows). Because each frame has different scopes with its own execution environment. Thus, it has a different global object and different constructors. So if you try to test an array against that frame's context, it will NOT return true, it will return incorrectly as false.

# Conclusion

In JavaScript, we can check if a variable is an array by using 3 methods, using the isArray method, using the instanceof operator and using checking the constructor type if it matches an Array object.
