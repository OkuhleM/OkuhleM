# Introduction
Today I'll be talking about the website that Tanille asked to do.

# Body

For the past month I've been busy with designing TCG website which took a lot of my time.
I want it to be attaractive so that when sponsors or other people check it out they can just 
contact me. 
This way I'll be exposing myself and my skills.
This website is supposed to be responsive and user friendly.

# Conclusion

I Haven't updated my blogpost for a long time because I've been really occupied but as soon as I'm done with what's taking my time, I'll be going back to updating my blogpost everyday.
