# Introduction

today I managed to finish the chapters that we were required to finish 
up infreecodecamp.

# Body

so today I started with freecodecamps projects and so far I managed to finish up
all the javascripts algorithm projects.
Currently I'm doing a Javascript Calculator.
This calculator should be able to take in 2 values and a calculation sign.
There should be a screen where it will display the calculations
It should also be able to have a button which will
clear the displayed information when clicked.

# Conclusion
So far my calculator is able to detect values but cannot calculate them
for now
