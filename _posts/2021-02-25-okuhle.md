# Introduction
getting through the day. Learning more about git hub.

# Body
I'm still having problems with creating files on terminal on my own.
I'm still having problems with pushing github files using terminal, I always have to force push them which is going to give me problems in the near future.

# Concllusion
I intend to make sure that by the end of next week I'll be able to push files inside git hub without having to force push.
