# Introduction



## What are If else?
The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement can be executed.

condition
An expression that is considered to be either truthy or falsy.
statement1
Statement that is executed if condition is truthy. Can be any statement, including further nested if statements. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements. To execute no statements, use an empty statement.

statement2
Statement that is executed if condition is falsy and the else clause exists. Can be any statement, including block statements and further nested if statements.

Multiple if...else statements can be nested to create an else if clause. Note that there is no elseif (in one word) keyword in JavaScript.

if (condition1)
  statement1
else if (condition2)
  statement2
else if (condition3)
  statement3
...
else
  statementN

  To see how this works, this is how it would look if the nesting were properly indented:

if (condition1)
  statement1
else
  if (condition2)
    statement2
  else
    if (condition3)
