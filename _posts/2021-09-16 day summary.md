# Introduction
 today I dealt withn code wars and freecode camp

# Body

today I dealt with  a katar whereby I had to create a function that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

It took me more than 10 minutes to get it right.
at first I manage to pass 30 strings.

# Conclusion

it required me to use the correct for loop. 
at first my for loop was less than the index, which gave a lot of errors
