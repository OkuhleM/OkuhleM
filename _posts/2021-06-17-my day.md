# Introduction

today I'll be talking about what I did today.

# Body

ever since I flashes my project and started it again I haven't been able to fix my submit button.
when it submits it returns undefined information.
so far my styling and my HTML is perfecly fine the only thing left to work is my javascript.
I managed to create multiple functions that do different kind of works
All of My functions return what they need to return.

# Conclusion
the project is due tomorrow and it's working a litte, the only thing left to fix is the buttons to
do what the user commands them do
