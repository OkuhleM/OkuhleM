# Introduction

Today I will be explaining how you get started with express.

# Body

before using express in your file or folder you have to install first
by writing 
   * npm install express --save
- this is where developers publish their node modules.
- when working with express you need just one send statement.
- installing express creates a node module folder also creates a package-lock.json file.
- Express handles basic headers and mime-types automatically.

you also have to Install nodemon by stating npm install nodemon --save-dev
- nodemon watches your project directory files and restarts the server incase any file is modified.
- helps by testing your changes without manually stopping and restart your sever.
- this module is only required for development and testing purposes.
- can also add scripts to the package.json file to execute command from locally installed modules.
- when using nodemon you write (npm start) on your terminal.

# Conclusion

So far working with express is not completly hard or challenging especially when you know all the
methods that express uses.
