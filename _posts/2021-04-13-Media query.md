- To test and monitor media states using the Window.matchMedia() and MediaQueryList.addListener() JavaScript methods.

## Media types

Media types describe the general category of a device. Except when using the not or only logical operators, the media type is optional and all types will be implied.

- Suitable for all devices.
print

- Intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode. (Please see paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to these formats.)
screen

# Conclusion

when I was creating my own website I used the media query for responsiveness but I didn't quite get it.
