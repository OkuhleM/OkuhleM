SVG Provides different shapes like lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses e.t.c today on Freecodecamp I dealt with 
creating rectangles.
designing visualization withn svg gives you more flexibility and power in what you can achieve.
an SVG is an image that is text-based.
it's structure is similar to that one of HTML.
it sit's on the DOM.
it's properties can be specified as attributes.
SVG should have absolute positions relative to the origin (0, 0)
