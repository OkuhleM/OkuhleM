# Introduction

today I'll be explaining what quality assurance

# Body
## what is quality assurance?

the maintenance of a desired level of quality in a service or product, especially by means of 
attention to every stage of the process of delivery or production.

Quality assurance encompasses the processes and procedures that systematically monitor different 
aspects of a service or facility. 
Through audits and other forms of assessment, quality assurance efforts detect and correct problems 
or variances that fall outside established standards or requirements.

Quality assurance methods focus on establishing good processes to produce products with the quality already 
built-in, rather than going through an unmonitored production process and trying to “inspect the quality” of 
a product that’s already been finished.
Concepts of quality control can be traced back to at least the Middle Ages and the rise of guilds. A craftsman 
could access a network of connections with other craftsmen and suppliers by joining a guild organization. 
He could then benefit from the reputation of the guild based on standards of quality in the products produced by its members.
The Industrial Revolution brought about more specialization in labor, as well as mechanization. Quality assurance evolved to 
address specialized tasks performed by workers. With the introduction of mass production, the need to monitor the quality of
components being produced by large numbers of workers created a role for quality inspectors.

## Modern Approaches
Today's approaches to quality assurance may differ depending on the industry. For example, a hospital might implement QA methods 
to improve the quality of healthcare. This could include defining quality by understanding core activities in effective patient 
care, setting quality benchmarks, and measuring quality with surveys, audits, and supervision.
Another business, such as a nutritional supplement manufacturer, would have completely different methods to ensure quality since 
its product parameters are completely different than a hospital. For example, the supplement company might guide its processes 
based on guidelines for active pharmaceutical ingredients.

## International Quality Assurance Standards
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was founded in 1947 with the goal of ensuring quality across national 
borders.1﻿ ISO consists of standards organizations that represent over 160 countries. It maintains an effective quality assurance 
system for manufacturing and service industries.

One product of the ISO is the set of standards that have become known as the ISO 9000 family. The criteria detailed in these 
management systems are designed to help organizations meet statutory and regulatory requirements for product quality and consumer 
needs.

Manufacturers and businesses can become certified by fulfilling the requirements defined in ISO 9001. This offers independent 
confirmation of an organization's adherence to quality standards. More than 1 million organizations around the world are ISO 9001 
certified.2﻿

To obtain ISO 9001 certification, the management of an organization develops quality assurance goals that are codified into 
policies and guidelines. These policies and guidelines are specifically designed to meet the unique needs of its business and 
manufacturing processes, and they're often crafted with the assistance of a consultant.

Once the organization implements the guidelines, the systems are assessed for compliance with ISO 9000 standards. The results of 
the assessment identify any areas that fall outside of ISO standards. If the organization addresses any problem areas within a 
given time frame, then it receives certification.

# Conclusion


Quality assurance can be defined as "part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will 
be fulfilled." The confidence provided by quality assurance is twofold—internally to management and externally to customers, 
government agencies, regulators, certifiers, and third parties.
