# Introduction

today on code wars I tried solving a katar that was supposed to return combined strings.
it had two parameters a name and lastName.

# Body
 fisrtly you have to use a method called concat().

 In JavaScript, concat() is a string method that is used to concatenate strings together. The concat() method appends one or more string values to the calling string and then returns the concatenated result as a new string. Because the concat() method is a method of the String object, it must be invoked through a particular instance of the String class.

                  syntax:
         string.concat(value1, value2, ... value_n);

Returns
The concat() method should return a new string that results from concatenating the original string with the string values that were passed in as parameters.

* Each of the parameter values will be converted to a string, if necessary, before the concatenation operation is performed.
* The concat() method does not change the value of the original string.
* You can also use the + operator to concatenate values together.
* You can use the concat() method with an empty string variable to concatenate primitive string values.
* The + operator allows you to concatenate strings without the need for the String object and the String concat() method.

# Conclusion

for combining strings you can either use the concat() method or the operator method.
