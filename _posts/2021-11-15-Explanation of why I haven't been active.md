# Introduction

Today I will be explaining what I have been doing so important that it 
took most of my time and I ended up not posting on my blogpost.

# Body

For the passed month and few passed days I wasn't able to post on my blogpost because
I have been busy with TCG's website.
We were working as a group on it which made a lot of mistakes and conflicts when it was time to merge 
because our styling was somehow repeating.

We took so much time fixing errors and trying to modify.after the website I tried completing my front end libraries projects
on FreeCodeCamp. So far I manage to do 2 of them and I am very impressed with my quote machine because I managed
to do it without refering to the internet.
I now understand Javascript a lot better than I did the passed few months.

# Conclusion 
The past month has been a rollercoaster to say the least but I'm glad that I finally moved to another project.
For this month my plan is to test my knowledge by giving myself tasks that don't require me to refer on the internet
especially stackoverflow.
