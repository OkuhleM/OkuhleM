# Introduction

ever since I started with JavaScript I didn't understand anything.
so I decided to go back and start afresh.

# Body
## What is a variable? 

a variable acts as a container which contains everything like your objects,
strings, numbers and other things.

in computer sciences data is anything that a computer is able to read or meaningful to the computer.
in JavaScript you can store a value in a variable with this (=) operator.
when JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of defined.
in JavaScript all variables and functions names are case sensitive.
you can have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing.

Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.
you can easily increment or add one to a variable with the (++)operator.
you can also decrement or decrease a variable by one with the (--) operator.
decimal numbers are sometimes refered to as floating points or floats.
there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.
such operator is the (+=) operator.

In JavaScript you can escape a quote  from considering it is an end of a string quote by placing a backslash
infront of the quote.

# Conclusion 
so far this is what I know about variables.6
