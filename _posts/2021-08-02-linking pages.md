# Introduction

Today I tried linking my pages.
the project that Moral gave us we're supposed to submit our information in another page.

# Body

Link Submit button to Another page using forms Tags in HTML In HTML’s Form tag we can Link submit Button to a different page using HTML Form’s Action Attribute.
Where we have to Declare/Write the Submit button Between HTML Form Tags and we have to assign our File Path inside HTML form’s action attribute.
Linking Submit buttons using Anchor Tag is Easy and Reliable method in HTML. 
We need to Write/Declare Submit button between Anchor tag’s Starting and Closing tags.

If you don’t need to use Form tag or Ancher tags to Link Submit button to a different page in HTML then we can use JavaScript for such cases. 
In JavaScript, we design a Function which will manage all the Data like Page Path where we want to Connect our Submit Button. 
The function name, By using that Function name we can call that function within HTML onClick attribute. 
Which we call the assigned function and we can redirect our users from one page to another by clicking on the Submit Button.

To link one page to another page in HTML using the buttons we can use HTML Anchor tags.
where we need to declare/Write HTML Button between Anchor tag's starting and ending tags.
(<a href=""><button>My Button</button></a>) Where inside HTML anchor tag's href="" we have to give our another page's path, where we want to link our webpage.
(<a href="another.html"><button>My Button</button></a>)

The Process of linking Submit button to another page in PHP is very Similar to HTML.
Because we can use HTML Elements inside PHP Document and Submit buttons are usually created using HTML Tags.
So using HTML Anchor tags or HTML Form Tags we can link submit button to another page in PHP.
