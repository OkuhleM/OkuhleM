  <h3 style="text-align: center;">FALLING IN LOVE WITH CODING<br></h3>

  <p> I fell in love with coding in 2017 when I was doing grade 11<br> Our school had just introduced code jika. I Was
    interested in coding because I was inlove with computers.</p>
  <p> By that time I didn't even know what coding was. but I was inlove with anything that had to do with Technology
    so
    I gave it a try.<br> Since that day I wanted nothing but to code.</p>
  <p>My interest in web developing keeps on growing.
    My greatest goal is to create a software. </p>
