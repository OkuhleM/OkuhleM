      <p>
        Hi, I am Lindokuhle Angel Mazibuko, I was born and raised in Diepsloot. I later moved to RiversideView. 
        Like any other person I faced a lot of hardships along the way and the important part is that I found myself 
        again. As a kid I fell in love with literature, how they played around with words and created a fantasy world 
        using language. I began to journal regularly and have always dreamed of being a professional writer. Growing 
        up in Diepsloot, High School gave me a glimpse of what real life looked like – with personal safety being a 
        constant concern. I'm the kind of person who tries to escape life whenever I get the chance hence I developed 
        an interest in computers in general. From there on I fell in love with programming and I found my way to coding. 
        The Coding Ground allowed me to learn a skill, be successful and build a career. As an emotional introvert, when 
        I’m coding, I get the chance to escape and focus on the code and I've never been happier.</p>
